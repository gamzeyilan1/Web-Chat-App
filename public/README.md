 This is a basic chat inspired by Reddit's r/offmychest community. 
 I've built this app in order to create a chat in which 
 people can share their troubles anonymously, just like in the subreddit, but
 actually get one to one interaction with the other online users.
 

 I've used Node, Express and Socket io for this one.

 Serve with:
 nodemon server.js
